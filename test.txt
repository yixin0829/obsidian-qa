Testing question: What is the difference between a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network?
Answer:  A convolutional neural network (CNN) uses a set of weights for each word across all time steps, while a recurrent neural network (RNN) uses the same set of weights for each word across all time steps and "remembers" information for all previous sequences by passing its hidden state.

Testing question: What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting in machine learning?
Answer:  Overfitting is when a model has high variance, meaning it fits the data too closely and is not generalizable. Underfitting is when a model has high bias, meaning it does not capture the complexity of the data and is not generalizable.

Testing question: What is the difference between precision and recall in machine learning evaluation metrics?
Answer:  Precision is the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives, while recall is the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives. Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, and is used to measure binary classification models.

Testing question: What is transfer learning and how can it be applied in machine learning?
Answer:  Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It aims to reduce the amount of training data needed for the second task by transferring the knowledge from the first task. It can be applied in machine learning by using a pre-trained model as the starting point for a new model, which can then be fine-tuned on the new task.
